# DigitRecognizer_MLproject
The files consist of grayscale images of hand-drawn digits ranging from 0 to 9.
Each image is represented as a 28x28 pixel grid, totaling 784 pixels, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, where higher values indicate darker shades.
The file contains 785 columns, where the first column, labeled "label", represents the digit depicted in the image, and the remaining 784 columns (named pixelx) represent the pixel intensity values. 
Each pixel can be mapped to its position in the 28x28 grid using the formula x = i * 28 + j, where i is the row number (0–27) and j is the column number (0–27). 
For example, pixel31 corresponds to the pixel located in the second row and fourth column of the grid.
